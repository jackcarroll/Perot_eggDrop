# Perot_eggDrop
repo for code associated with the Perot Museum Egg/Capsule Drop Engineering Challenge in the ChallENGe Lab.

Most code is built to run within the Arduino or Processing IDE's. Written in C++ and Java respectively.

TestCapsule is test code built for an arduino uno, but simulates the actions taken by the Qduino within the capsule.

BaseStationV1_2, EggDropScoresV1_2, and EggDropScoresV3_2 are all built to work together in one system. Used during testing August 2019.
