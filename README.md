# Perot_eggDrop
repo for code associated with the Perot Museum Egg/Capsule Drop Engineering Challenge

Most code is built to run either on an Arduino MEGA, or within the Processing environment on any type of computer.
TestCapsule is test code built for an arduino uno, but simulates the actions taken by the Qduino within the capsule.
